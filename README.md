# Wirekite for MacOS

Wire up digital and analog IOs to your Mac and control them with your Swift or Objective-C code run on your Mac.

To connect the inputs and outputs, use a [Teensy development board](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) connected via USB. It looks a lot like an Arduino Nano connected for programming. Yet with Wirekite the custom code is written for and run on your computer â€“ not for the microcontroller.

This repository contains the MacOS code. There are separate repositories for the [Teensy code](https://github.com/manuelbl/Wirekite) and the Windows code (coming soon).

## Supported boards

- [Teensy LC](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensylc.html)
- [Teensy 3.2](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy32.html) (soon)

## Supported inputs / outputs / protocols

- Digital output
- Digital input
- Analog input
- PWM output
- I2C (soon)


# Getting started

### 1. Prepare the Teensy board for Wirekite

Download the ready-to-use code for the Teensy and install it on your Teensy board. This is a one-time step.

[See instructions](https://github.com/manuelbl/Wirekite/blob/master/docs/prepare_teensy.md)

### 2. Install CocoaPods

CocoaPods manages libraries for your Xcode projects. If you have been writing software with Xcode, you probably have it installed already.

If not, see [CocoaPods Getting Started](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) for instructions.

### 3. Setup a new Xcode project

*Blink* is a simple example that blinks the LED on the Teensy board.
So you don't need to wire up anything to the Teensy.

The [instructions](xx) guide you through the Xcode project setup.
